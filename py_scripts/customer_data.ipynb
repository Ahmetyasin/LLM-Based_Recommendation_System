       "0     This cable worked out well for me and is a very heavy-duty cable. I was having trouble with wifi on a new Mac Mini and decided to wire it directly to the router. I don't know why, but the Mini just wasn't getting good wifi even though it sits next to the router, but I still needed the router for my laptop and other misc stuff like a blu ray player, so I just used an extra ethernet port in the router and wired the Mini directly--it solved the problem (if you do this, be sure to tell the item that you are hardwiring to shut off the wireless).\\n\\nWorks great, nice to solve a problem so cheaply and easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1     I have never bought a Belkin product i wasn't satisfied with. This is no exception. Not that i really give this cord any thought now that it's in use, but that is the point, isn't it? I guess the only other thing to say, is that being blue, it's easy to find in the mass of cords around my TV and computer area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2     I'll make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works.  First and foremost:  it works and works well.  It may be only be 3 feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as I need it.  If I were lucid when I measured the location I would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what I needed at the time and now the length is perfect.  I have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but NOT this Belkin.  It is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient.  Those elements alone would be worth buying this cable; however, when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it under any circumstances that work.   \n",
       "3     * The setup is as short and simple as the instructions.\\n* My wireless capable TV connected to the internet as soon as I selected the wired network setting.\\n* Streaming a movie was not what I expected. The video had to re-buffer frequently. I never had this problem using my 802.11g wireless connection.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the instructions say, \"Do not plug unit into a power strip.\" I only have one outlet near my router, and there is a similar Netgear device occupying that outlet. The Netgear device has an outlet so you don't lose an outlet when using this device. I had to plug the Belkin into the Netgear. This is probably violating the \"No power strip rule\".

       "4     Currently I'm moving some family memories from older VHS tapes to DVD-Ram and ripping them to a digital format on my PC.  Since these are important memories, I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' VHS tapes is something important to me.  Comparing these tapes to local price, the price here on Amazon is very competitive.  After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting.  Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur, but it's great to be able to get this product when you need it, for a reasonable price.                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "9850  I think this is an improvement over the many stainless steel French presses I've had. It's stainless steel so it can take some rough treatment and not break. That's huge, that alone.It is easy to wash and can be placed in the dishwasher.It looks like a percolator almost, but it's a real French press.

Whether you are a huge coffee drinker or just grab a cup on occasion, a press still might be for you.  This is actually my second press and the ease and convenience is a great selling point.  But it always makes great coffee.  :)This is great as it takes up very little counter space or can be easily taken with you (camping, for instance).  It's a beautiful design, very sleek and modern.  The construction quality is very good and durable.  The press has a tight &#34;seal&#34; and you do not get grounds in your coffee.  Overall, I'm very pleased and much happier with this press than I am a coffee pot that is 3-4 times its size.                                        \n",
       "9854  This is a great press. Attractive, does the job, sturdy, and keeps coffee warmer.This is my 5th press I've owned. I currently am down to 3, including this one. The glass ones tend to get broken over time, so this is great because there are no pieces to break.The lid and press parts fit tight, without leaking.  It's insulated, so it keeps your coffee warmer longer. It also looks nice.

Dr. Oetker is apparently a popular brand in Europe that is trying to gain a foothold in the American market (you can see that the packaging has very little English on it).I immediately found a recipe for a Pumpkin Cheesecake, and we baked it using this pan.  The pan worked perfectly as there was no leaking.  The pan came apart easily and the cheesecake was fantastic.  The pan was easy to clean as well.  It seems durable and I like the paint color.We look forward to making plenty of cheesecakes and flourless cakes using this spring form pan.\n",

The pocket is not too deep, but certainly large enough for pencils, pens, and most phones.  The inside of this backpack is large and roomy.  Unfortunately there are no interior pockets.  There are what I would call water bottle pockets on each side.  The back is slightly padded, as are the shoulder straps.  A little more padding would have been nice.  I keep wondering if the hood, partially covering the back, is for anything.  Ive looked and looked, and I think its only as an accent to the backpack.  Made in China.\n",

The thick padding makes me know my laptop is secure and although I don't have a tablet, the fact that once I do get one, there's room for it, is a plus..  The front pocket, which has a zipper, allows easy access easy to a few items stored therein, while the drawstring, which is under the lid, keeps whatever I put therein secure.

Though there is most definitely a sacrifice in carry-on convenience, these would have been wonderful on my recent flight to & from Europe. I could hardly make it through a movie wearing my painful in-ear buds. The Bluetooth feature is awesome while at home, giving me freedom of movement while listening to music, books or podcasts. There is also an auxiliary cord for use on flights or non-Bluetooth situations. The sound is very clear and controls are strategically placed. Definitely worth the increase in size for the comfort and clarity!\n",

Mine arrived in great condition, though the box did have a hole in it, at least the press was not damaged or scratched. It makes a great cup of coffee and I didn't detect any metallic taste. I like that, unlike the glass beakers, it is unbreakable. The price is reasonable, and it really is pretty. Plus, it makes a great cup of java and keeps it hot for awhile, too (although you might get a pretty strong cup of coffee if you keep it in the press for too long!). All in all, a good buy for a great coffee press. If they could get the packaging in better order, it would also make a great gift.\n",

I bought many different poppers,  as I do not like microwave popcorn. I got a much more expensive one and although it looked cute, it only made a small amt. It was also a real pain to clean. This is a nice size bowl. Clean up is a breeze. So easy! Do not hesitate. Use coconut oil & flavacol and you will have \"Movie theater style\" popcorn. They are both sold on amazon.com\n",

This looks and feels exactly like the one grandma used to have, with one small complaint. If you over tighten the lid, it will pop off, and if you under tighten the lid, it will pop off. You have to get it just right. Fortunately, it's not like you're opening and closing it that often. Open, fill, tighten, and you're off to the races.

Some reviewers didn't mention this so perhaps the clarity of the steeped tea depends on the type of loose tea leaves one buys.  Also, it makes about one china teacup of tea - OK if you are a china teacup tea sipper but if you want a big mug of tea you will need to perform the steeping procedure twice.  This would be nice for loose tea enthusiasts at work who wish to dispense with an extra mug/teacup as you can drink the tea from the outer double walled glass collector.\n",

In other words, there are two layers of thin metal mesh to ensure even the smallest seeds and particles are caught in the net.It has a traditional soft black rubber Oxo handle, too.

      "For one of the products I bought, I wrote this comment: I love this product, but as a regular tea drinker, it's a long time to wait for coffee. After you wait to heat the water and pour it in, you wait two minutes for it to steep. Then stir, and then wait another minute.  By the time you open the switch to release the water into the cup, the coffee is lukewarm.  So of course next time I will make sure I boil the water fully!  Then, as a non-coffee drinker, I didn't know how much ground coffee to put in, and the directions were no help.  It says to put in 15g of coffee for 8oz of water......??? A tablespoon was too strong so again, I'll know for next time! I don't know what instant coffee tastes like so I cannot attest to flavor differences, but I will surely be using this product for any coffee making needs!\n",
